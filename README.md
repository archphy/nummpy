nummpy (NUMerical Methods Python library) provides a narrow range of numerical 
methods and auxiliary functions. It has a syntax similar to numpy's one. It is 
not intended to replace existing libraries - numpy and scipy are faster, have 
more features and are more robust. This is a personal project maintained as a 
hobby and for educational purposes. It comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
